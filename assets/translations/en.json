However, what some saw as a fashion statement, others viewed as an insult to America and its soldiers. As a result, according to historical sources, the summer of 1943 made world headlines with attacks on these minority communities in Los Angeles. To stop the attacks, the Los Angeles City Council banned Zoot Suits."

After Zanzibar was declared a protectorate of the British Empire, Britain installed its own sultan to control it: Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini. However, the sultan suddenly died in 1896, and Sultan Khalid bin Barghash took the throne without consulting Britain. Britain was not happy with this situation, so they asked him to step down. The new sultan refused to abdicate, and the British bombarded the palace. The conflict ended in 38 minutes."

        "conntent_2" : "Those who know something about ancient Egypt will recognize that Egyptians respected cats and some even worshipped them (they even had a cat goddess named Bastet). During the Battle of Pelusium, the invading Persian Army led by Cambyses II won a crucial phase of the battle by taking advantage of Egyptian religion. According to Macedonian historian Polyaenus, the Persian Commander ordered his soldiers to use 'sacred' cats to protect themselves from Egyptian attack. Although the Persian victory was an inevitable outcome, they saved many soldiers by using this tactic. Herodotus wrote that only 7,000 Persians fell in the battle, while more than 50,000 Egyptians lost their lives."

        "conntent_2" : "It would not be fair to look at people who lived in the Middle Ages as 'never having bathed'. This misconception most likely stems from the church's opposition to the mixed baths that were common during the Roman period. In reality, the church had bathhouses built near churches and pilgrimage sites, separate for women and men. Being able to bathe at home was a privilege for the wealthy."
